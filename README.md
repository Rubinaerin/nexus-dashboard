## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
  git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexus-dashboard.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexus-dashboard.git)
```
```bash
   npm install
```
  ```bash
   npm run dev
```
   ```bash
   npm run build
```


To make the images appear inside your README on GitHub, follow these steps:

1.  **Create an Assets Folder:** In your project folder (`nexus-dashboard`), create a new folder named `assets`.
2.  **Rename your Screenshots:** Give your files simple names (e.g., rename *Ekran Resmi 2026-01-21 22.56.39.png* to `dashboard-dark.png`).
3.  **Move the Images:** Put all the screenshots inside the `assets` folder.
4.  **Upload to GitHub:**
    * `git add assets/`
    * `git commit -m "docs: add screenshots for README"`
    * `git push origin main`
5.  **The Link Logic:** In the README code I gave you, notice the line: `![Dashboard Dark](./assets/dashboard-dark.png)`. This tells GitHub to look into the assets folder and display that specific image.

### How it will look:
* **Text:** Your titles and descriptions will be bold and clean.
* **Images:** They will appear directly under the "Screenshots" heading, allowing employers to see your work without having to run the code.
* **Icons:** The emojis (🚀, 📊, 🌓) add a "SaaS product" feel to the documentation.

**Would you like me to help you set up a Vercel account so you can also add a "Live Demo" link to this README?** That is usually the final step to make it 100% professional.
